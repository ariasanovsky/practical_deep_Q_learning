# practical_deep_Q_learning
 Practicing PyToch and deep Q learning with [Phil Taber's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-q-learning-from-paper-to-code/).  

I recommend setting up the build environment in a Conda terminal with: 

```conda env create -f envrionment.yml```

Activate the environment with: 

```conda activate practical_deep_Q_learning```

I can use LaTeX in markdown!  
```math
\sum_{n=1}^\infty\dfrac{1}{n^2} = \dfrac{\pi^2}{6}
```
