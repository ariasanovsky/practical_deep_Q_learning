# practical_deep_Q_learning

## setup

 Practicing PyToch and deep Q learning with [Phil Taber's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-q-learning-from-paper-to-code/).  

I recommend setting up the build environment in a Conda terminal with:

```conda env create -f envrionment.yml```

Activate the environment with:

```conda activate qlearn```
