# Syntax for neural networks

In this folder, we write some boilerplate code that familiarizes us with neural networks as implemented in pytorch.
Neural nets model real-valued functions with layers, starting with the argments of the function, layered with intermediate variables connected by RELU or other activations.
We fit functions to data by following gradient descent or some other protocol to minimize loss.  It is easy to see that NNs have very simple derivatives which are all handled on the backend.
